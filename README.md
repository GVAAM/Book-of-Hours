### How to Enable Large File Storage (LFS) in GitHub Desktop

1. **Clone the Repository in GitHub Desktop:**
   - Open GitHub Desktop.
   - Navigate to the repository you want to clone.
   - Click on the "Code" button and select "Open with GitHub Desktop" to clone the repository.

2. **Enable LFS:**
   - After cloning, if you see a message stating "Large File Storage (LFS) is not enabled for this repository", follow these steps:
     - Click on the "Repository" menu.
     - Select "Open in Command Prompt".
     - Execute the command `git lfs install` to initialize Git LFS in the repository.

   - If the LFS enable message doesn't appear, manually initialize Git LFS by:
     - Opening the repository in Command Prompt.
     - Running the command `git lfs install`.

3. **Fetch LFS Data:**
   - To fetch the LFS data for the repository, use the command `git lfs pull`.
   - This command will download the LFS files to your local repository.

4. **Verify LFS Files:**
   - After executing `git lfs pull`, verify the presence of LFS files in your local repository folder.

### Additional Notes:

- Enabling LFS allows you to efficiently store large files in your Git repositories.
- Make sure to commit and push any changes after enabling LFS to ensure that the large files are properly tracked and stored.
- For further assistance or troubleshooting, refer to the official GitHub documentation on Large File Storage (LFS).
